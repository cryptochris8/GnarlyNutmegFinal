## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

**Dependencies**:
- `hytopia: ^0.10.30` - Core multiplayer game engine
- `mediasoup: ^3.18.0` - WebRTC-based real-time networking
- `@hytopia.com/assets: ^0.3.16` - Asset management
- `@gltf-transform/cli: ^4.2.1` - 3D model processing

**Development Tools**:

### System Architecture

The game follows a **dual-layer AI architecture** with strict separation of concerns:

1. **Strategic Layer** (SoccerAgent.ts)
   - High-level decision making
   - Position awareness and team coordination
   - Stamina-based performance degradation
   - Role-specific behavioral parameters

2. **Tactical Layer** (BehaviorTree.ts)
   - Frame-by-frame action execution
   - Classic behavior tree pattern (Selector/Sequence nodes)
   - Condition evaluation and action execution
   - Fallback logic for robust behavior

## Game Mode System

The project implements **three completely separate game modes** with strict isolation:

### 1. FIFA Mode (Default)

// gameMode.ts:14-42
FIFA_MODE_CONFIG = {
  halfDuration: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  totalHalves: 2
  halftimeDuration: 120 seconds
  ballPhysics: { damping: 0.95, friction: 0.8, bounciness: 0.6 }

## AI System Architecture

### 6v6 Team Structure

Each team has **6 distinct AI roles** with unique behaviors:

1. **Goalkeeper** (index.ts references)
   - Zone: Goal area (narrow positioning)
   - Priority: Ball blocking, save attempts
   - Special: Reduced shooting range

2. **Left-Back** (defensive)
   - Zone: Left defensive third
   - Priority: Interception, defensive coverage
   - Behavior: Conservative positioning

3. **Right-Back** (defensive)
   - Zone: Right defensive third
   - Priority: Interception, defensive coverage
   - Behavior: Conservative positioning

4. **Central-Midfielder-1** (balanced)
   - Zone: Central midfield
   - Priority: Build-up play, distribution
   - Behavior: Relaxed passing criteria (allows backwards passes up to 12 units)

5. **Central-Midfielder-2** (balanced)
   - Zone: Central midfield
   - Priority: Build-up play, distribution
   - Behavior: Balanced attack/defense

6. **Striker** (attacking)
   - Zone: Attacking third
   - Priority: Shooting, goal scoring
   - Special: Extended shooting range (12 units vs 8 units default)

### AI Decision Making

**SoccerAgent Strategic Logic** (SoccerAgent.ts):

```typescript
// Shooting range calculation (role-specific + stamina-based)
public withinShootingRange(): boolean {
  let maxShootingRange = 8; // Base range
  if (this.entity.aiRole === 'striker') {
    maxShootingRange = 12; // Striker bonus
  }

  // Stamina degradation
  if (staminaPercentage < 30) {
    maxShootingRange *= 0.7; // 30% range reduction when tired
  }

  return distanceToGoal <= maxShootingRange;
}

// Passing decision (build-up play support)
public teammateBetterPositioned(): boolean {
  // Allows backwards passes for build-up
  if (teammateDistanceToGoal < myDistanceToGoal * 0.95) {
    return true;
  }
  // Also considers teammate shooting range advantage
}
```

**BehaviorTree Tactical Pattern** (BehaviorTree.ts):

```typescript
// Classic behavior tree architecture
export abstract class BehaviorNode {
  abstract execute(agent: AIPlayerEntity): boolean;
}

export class Selector extends BehaviorNode {
  // OR logic - first successful child wins
  execute(agent): boolean {
    for (child of this.children) {
      if (child.execute(agent)) return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}

export class Sequence extends BehaviorNode {
  // AND logic - all must succeed
  execute(agent): boolean {
    for (child of this.children) {
      if (!child.execute(agent)) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}

// Example decision hierarchy:
// Selector (root)
//   ├─ Sequence (has ball)
//   │   ├─ Condition: hasBall()
//   │   └─ Selector (attack options)
//   │       ├─ Action: pass()
//   │       ├─ Action: shoot()
//   │       └─ Action: dribble()
//   ├─ Sequence (defend)
//   │   ├─ Condition: opponentHasBall()
//   │   └─ Action: pressOpponent()
//   └─ Action: pursueBall() (fallback)
```

## Physics System

### Ball Physics

**FIFA Mode** (realistic):
```typescript
BALL_CONFIG = {
  SCALE: 0.2
  RADIUS: 0.2
  FRICTION: 0.5
  LINEAR_DAMPING: 0.8 // Gradual slowdown
  ANGULAR_DAMPING: 3.5 // Spin decay
  HORIZONTAL_FORCE: 0.3
  VERTICAL_FORCE: 0.5
  UPWARD_BIAS: 0.15
}
```

**Arcade Mode** (enhanced):
```typescript
ARCADE_BALL_CONFIG = {
  FRICTION: 0.3 // Less friction for faster play
  LINEAR_DAMPING: 0.6 // More dynamic movement
  ANGULAR_DAMPING: 2.5 // More spin effects
  HORIZONTAL_FORCE: 0.5 // More bouncing
  VERTICAL_FORCE: 0.7 // Higher bounces
  UPWARD_BIAS: 0.25 // Dramatic air effects
}
```

**Arcade Physics Multipliers** (gameModes.ts:222-228):
- Shot power: +30%
- Pass speed: +20%
- Player speed: +10%
- Jump height: +40%
- Ball spin: +50%

---

## Timing System

**Match Duration** (gameState.ts references):
```typescript
HALF_DURATION = 300 seconds (5 minutes)
TOTAL_HALVES = 2
TOTAL_MATCH_TIME = 600 seconds (10 minutes)
HALFTIME_DURATION = 120 seconds (manual button-triggered)

// Additional timing features:
STOPPAGE_TIME = random(15, 59) seconds
OVERTIME_DURATION = 60 seconds (sudden death for tied games)
```

**Halftime System**:
- Manual activation (button-triggered, not automatic)
- 2-minute break period
- Team stats display
- Player repositioning

## Hytopia SDK Integration

### Core SDK Patterns Identified

From studying the SDK documentation via MCP resources:

**1. Entity System**:
```typescript
// Custom player extension
class AIPlayerEntity extends DefaultPlayerEntity {
  public aiRole: string;
  public stamina: number;
  public behaviorTree: BehaviorNode;

  constructor(world: World) {
    super(world);
    this.setRigidBodyType(RigidBodyType.DYNAMIC);
  }
}
```

**2. World Management**:
- Multi-world support (different game instances)
- Map loading via GLTF models
- Entity spawning and lifecycle management
- Physics simulation integration

**3. Physics System**:
- RigidBodyType: DYNAMIC (physics-affected), KINEMATIC (code-controlled), FIXED (static)
- Collision detection and response
- Force application for ball movement
- Custom physics parameters per mode

**4. Networking** (mediasoup integration):
- WebRTC-based real-time synchronization
- Player connection/disconnection handling
- State replication across clients
- Low-latency multiplayer support

**5. UI System**:
```typescript
// HTML/CSS/JS integration for UI
world.ui.show(playerEntity, {
  html: '<div>Score: 3-2</div>',
  css: 'color: white; font-size: 24px;',
  position: 'top-center'
});

// Scene UI for 3D world labels
world.sceneUI.create(entity, {
  content: 'Player Name',
  offset: { y: 2 }
});
```

**6. Audio System**:
- Spatial audio positioning
- Background music management
- Sound effects with volume control
- Crowd atmosphere (FIFA mode)

**7. Pathfinding**:
- AI navigation for player movement
- Obstacle avoidance
- Dynamic path recalculation

## Key Implementation Details

### Entry Point (index.ts)

```typescript
startServer((world) => {
  // World setup
  world.loadMap(worldMap);

  // Core systems initialization
  const soccerBall = createSoccerBall(world);
  const aiPlayers = createAITeams(world); // 12 AI players (6v6)
  const game = new SoccerGame(world, soccerBall, aiPlayers);

  // Mode-specific managers
  const arcadeManager = new ArcadeEnhancementManager(world);
  const pickupManager = new PickupGameManager(world);
  const tournamentManager = new TournamentManager(world);
  const fifaCrowdManager = new FIFACrowdManager(world);

  // Game loop
  world.onTick(() => {
    game.update();
    // Mode-specific updates based on getCurrentGameMode()
  });
});
```

### Mode Switching (gameModes.ts:155-158)

```typescript
export const setGameMode = (mode: GameMode): void => {
  console.log(`Switching from ${currentGameMode} to ${mode} mode`);
  currentGameMode = mode;
  // All systems check getCurrentModeConfig() dynamically
};
```

**Mode Isolation Strategy**:
- Never modifies FIFA_MODE_CONFIG at runtime
- Each mode has completely separate configuration objects
- Helper functions: `isFIFAMode()`, `isArcadeMode()`, `isTournamentMode()`
- Systems query mode before applying enhancements

---

## Notable Design Patterns

### 1. **Behavior Tree Pattern**
Classic AI decision-making with composable nodes (Selector, Sequence, Condition, Action)

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**
Game modes as interchangeable strategy objects with `getCurrentModeConfig()`

### 3. **Entity-Component System**
Hytopia SDK's entity architecture with component-based functionality

### 4. **Manager Pattern**
Specialized managers: ArcadeEnhancementManager, PickupGameManager, TournamentManager, FIFACrowdManager

### 5. **State Machine** (implied in game flow)
Match states: Pre-game → First Half → Halftime → Second Half → Stoppage Time → Overtime → Post-game

### 6. **Observer Pattern** (SDK events)
World tick events, collision events, player join/leave events
